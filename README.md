# 🧠 Project Teams

A real-time collaboration platform where teams can chat, share ideas, and work together seamlessly. Think of it as your own lightweight Notion meets Slack — built to help teams stay connected and productive.

> 🚧 **Heads up:** This is still a work in progress! Core features are working, but I'm actively improving document syncing and ironing out some WebRTC quirks.

## 🛠️ Built With

| **Frontend** | React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Socket.IO Client |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Mongoose |
| **Database** | MongoDB |
| **Real-time Magic** | WebSockets (Socket.IO), WebRTC |
| **Dev Tools** | TypeScript, Vite, ESLint |

## ✨ What It Does

Right now, the app lets you:

- 💬 **Chat in real-time** — instant messaging across team rooms
- 📄 **Edit documents together** — collaborative editing with live updates
- 🟢 **See who's around** — presence indicators show who's online
- 🔄 **Version history** (coming soon) — never lose track of changes
- 🎥 **Video rooms** (in the works) — peer-to-peer calls using WebRTC
- 🔐 **Secure sharing** (planned) — role-based access control for docs
